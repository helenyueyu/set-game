Live demo: https://tokyosuite.github.io/set-game/

My goal is to work on the project in chunks over the next few days, and not to attempt to complete this in one sitting (as doing so is pretty energy and brain-power draining). My estimated time is 3-5 days on this project, 2 or 3 hours each day. I'll also chronicle the stuff I learned for each day. I think this will be a good change of pace, and a venture into a different style of doing projects.
